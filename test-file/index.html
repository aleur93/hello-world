        <p>It has been months since we last saw each other. I miss you a lot kid, but I have learned a lot in this adventure I embarked. I want you to have a hunger to travel, I want you to one day find yourself in a foreign country with completely different people. Not because there is anything wrong with your country, but because discovering something new is amazing. I want you to meet:</p>
